# slug_autoupdate
TYPO3 Slug URL Segment Auto Update

Extends the TYPO3 Pages with an AutoUpdate of the Slug field, used for speaking URLs.

Usually you must update each page on move or editing the title. Some Editors will forgot it, 
and the URL keeps the old name. With this extension, it will update the slug URL-Segment automaticly,
after editing the title or moving the page, recursively.

By default the AutoUpdate field ist enabled and hides the SLUG Field.
You can disable the AutoUpdate for each page. Subpages still be auto updated if enabled.
